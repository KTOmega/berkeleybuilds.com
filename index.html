					<h1>ABOUT</h1>
					<p>
						Berkeley  Builds  is  a  social  innovation  designathon  on  UC  Berkeleyâ€™s  campus  that  invites students  from  all  academic  disciplines  to  implement  sustainable  solutions  to  social  issues  both  domestically  and  internationally.  Through  collaboration  with  a  diverse  leadership  of  student-run  organizations  focused  on  a  range  of  topics  from  social  impact  to  technology  to  consulting,  we  encourage  students  to  design  solutions  to  address  real  problems. At  the  event,  we  aim  to  maintain  a  mutually  beneficial  relationship  with  the  nonprofit  organizations  and  corporate  sponsors.  The  students  gain  hands-on  experience  and  have the  opportunity  to  make  a  significant  impact  while  networking  with  potential  future  employees.  At  the  same  time,  participating  organizations  and  companies  get  the  opportunity  to  market  their  organization,  advocate  for  their  cause,  and  meet  potential  recruits.
